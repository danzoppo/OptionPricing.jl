# OptionPricing

OptionPricing is a package for basic financial option pricing models. The models
focus on the use of Monte Carlo methods in particular the Least Squares Monte 
Carlo algorithm of Lonstaff & Schwartz (2001) and its variants. The options that can be priced include American, Asian, Swing and European.



The goal is simplicity for fast and accurate valuations.

Work in progress.
